Discord CTF bot

[ARCHIVED]

Discord bot for CTFtime and CTFing in general, under construction.

List of features to be developped:
* Create channels for CTFs
* Get challenge list
* Different colors for "working" and "solved" challenges
* Assign team members to tasks
* Get scoreboard
* Get ranking in the current CTF
* Get ranking on CTFtime
* Calendar to choose our CTFs

* ... and more to come

(will probably never be finished, but hell maybe one day I'll use the code template for another bot!)
